X32 VCA Automation widget 
=========================

This will, at some point, hopefully take a VCA plot expressed in a spreadsheet and generate a set of OSC cues in QLab to run VCA automation on an X32, in the same way as CH Soundâ€™s Palladium does, or DiGiCo SD-T Series software, just without the price tag. 

It is based upon work by F53, the creators of QLab, and Jay Anslow, but is not associated with either of them.
